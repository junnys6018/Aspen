# Basics

## Comments

Aspen uses C style comments.

```
// this is a line comment

/*
    this block comment
    can span multiple lines
*/
```

## Printing

All output in Aspen is done through the `print` statement.

```
print "Hello, world!";
```

<Alert level="info">There is no way to read input in an Aspen program.</Alert>

## Variables

Variables are declared with the `let` keyword.

```
let n i64;
let foo string;
```

Aspen is statically typed, every variable must be annotated with a type. In the example above, `n` is a variable of type `i64`, a 64 bit integer and `foo` has type `string`.

There is no type inference in Aspen, every variable must be declared with a type.

<Alert level="error">

    ### All variables must be declared with a type

    ```
    let name = "Arun Muthu";
    ```

</Alert>

<Alert level="success">

    ### `name` has been annotated with the type `string`

    ```
    let name string = "Arun Muthu";
    ```

</Alert>

## Reserved Keywords

Here is the list of keywords reserved by Aspen.

```
else for fn void if print return true false let while i64 u64 bool string double
```

## Blocks

Similar to how parenthesis group multiple expressions into one big expression, a block groups multiple statements into one big statement. A block creates a _local scope_, variables declared inside a block will only be visible inside the block.

```
{
    let greeting string = "こんにちは";
    print greeting;
}
let welcome string = greeting + " Jordan."; // error, greeting is out of scope
```

Blocks always appear after an `if`, `while` or `for` statement.

```
if (12*12 > 100) {
    print "12*12 is greater than 100.";
}
```
