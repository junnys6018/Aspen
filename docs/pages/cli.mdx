Options
    <path>
    The path to the aspen source file to execute

    -i or --interpret
    Execute the program using the tree walk implementation

    -l or --lex
    Do lexical analysis on the source code and print out the tokens scanned

    Parse the source code and print out the ast as an S-expression

<Alert level="warning">
    Two implementations of Aspen are planned, a tree walk interpreter and a byte code vm. The `-i` flag is intended to
    select between which implementation to use. Currently only the tree walk interpreter has been implemented so this
    flag does nothing.
