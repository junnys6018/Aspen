# Control Flow

Aspen has the standard control flow constructs found in many programming languages: `if`, `while` and `for`.

## If Statements

The `if` statement takes a boolean expression. If the expression evaluates to `true` then the block following will be executed.

```
if (/* condition */) {
    // code...
}
```

<Alert level="warning">

The code following any control flow construct **must** be a block. The following is not allowed:

```
if (true)
    print "Not allowed";
```

</Alert>

`if` statements can be chained with `else if` and `else`.

```
if (/* condition */) {
    // code...
} else if (/* condition */) {
    // code...
} else {
    // code...
}
```

## While Loops

A `while` loop takes a boolean expression. The code in a `while` loop is executed until the boolean expression is `false`.

```
let i i64 = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    print i;
    i = i + 1;
}
```

## For Loops

`for` loops are what you expect.


```
for (let i i64 = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) {
    print i;
}
```

<Alert level="warning">

Aspen does not have the `++` or `+=` operator commonly found in other programming languages.
