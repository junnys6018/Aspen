# Welcome!

Aspen is a toy programming language created for learning purposes.

```
fn list(generator fn(i64)i64, n i64) void {
    for (let i i64 = 0; i <= n; i = i + 1) {
        print generator(i);
    }
}

fn square(n i64) i64 {
    return n * n;
}

list(square, 10);
```

## Why?

Aspen was created purely for educational purposes, in fact this website was created as an exercise in web development. Aspen is not a well designed language nor was it intended it be. Many features expected from a programming language such as arrays are missing. Instead Aspen was created to learn about how programming languages are implemented. The features that exist in Aspen are there purely because I wanted to learn how they are implemented.

## Getting Started

Aspen can be downloaded locally on [GitHub](https://github.com/junnys6018/Aspen), or you can try out our online <Link href="/playground"><a>playground</a></Link> to start writing Aspen programs in the browser.
