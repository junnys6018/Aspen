## Variables

Aspen is statically typed, variables are declared like so:

```
let n i64 = 42;
let foo string = "bar";
```

There is no type inference in Aspen, nor is there default initialization. Every variable declared must be initialized.

Functions are first class objects in Aspen, a variable with a function type can be declared like so:

```
let func fn(i64, i64)string;
```

Here `func` is a variable of type `fn(i64, i64)string`, i.e. a function that takes 2 integer parameters and returns a string.

## Primitive Types

Aspen has the following built in datatypes

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`i64`</td>
        <td>64 bit signed integer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`u64`</td>
        <td>64 bit unsigned integer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`bool`</td>
        <td>Boolean value.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`string`</td>
        <td>A UTF-32 encoded string.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>`double`</td>
        <td>64 bit floating point number.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Type Casting

Type casting can be done with function call syntax.

```
print i64(1.5);  // convert a double to i64
print double(3); // convert a i64 to double
```

Currently only type casting between numeric types (`i64`, `u64`, `double`) are allowed. Signed integers and floating point numbers can be converted to and from strings with the built in functions:

```
print itoa(3);      // i64 -> string
print ftoa(1.5);    // double -> string
print atoi("9");    // string -> i64
print atof("3.14"); // string -> double
```

0 is returned if a string cannot be converted to a numeric type. These string conversion functions are useful for formatting output.

```
let firstName string = "John";
let lastName string = "Doe";
let age i64 = 23;
print firstName + " " + lastName + " is " + itoa(age) + " years old.";
```

export default ({ children }) => <DocsLayout>{children}</DocsLayout>;
